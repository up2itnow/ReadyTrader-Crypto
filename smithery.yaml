runtime: "container"

# Smithery project configuration for ReadyTrader.
#
# Notes:
# - Smithery requires this file be placed in the repository root and named `smithery.yaml`.
# - We use `runtime: container` because ReadyTrader is a Python MCP server shipped via Docker.
# - The Docker image entrypoint is defined in `Dockerfile` (defaults to `fastmcp run server.py`).
#
# If/when you publish to Smithery and need Streamable HTTP transport, you can update the
# container command/env to run FastMCP in HTTP transport mode (see FastMCP docs).

runtime: container

# Smithery will build and run this project using Docker.
# We run FastMCP in streamable-http mode so Smithery (and remote clients) can connect over HTTP.
